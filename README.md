Heavily inspired by [saaskit](https://github.com/saaskit/saaskit)

See the [sample app for a full display of all the current features](https://github.com/dazinator/Dotnettency/tree/master/src/Dotnettency.Sample) or if you want to see MVC in action, checkout the [MVC sample](https://github.com/dazinator/Dotnettency/tree/develop/src/Sample.Mvc) which include:

- Tenant resolution
- Per Tenant Middleware Pipeline
- Per Tenant Containers
- Per Tenant HostingEnvironment

Tenant Resolution

Once configured in `startup.cs` you can:

- Inject `TTenant` directly (may block whilst resolving current tenant).
- Inject `Task<TTenant>` - Allows you to `await` the current `Tenant` (so non blocking). `Task<TTenant>` is convenient.
- Inject `ITenantAccessor<TTenant>`. This is similar to injecting `Task<Tenant>` in that it provides lazy access the current tenant in a non blocking way. For convenience it's now easier to just inject `Task<Tenant>` instead, unless you want a more descriptive API.
- Inject `ITenantShellAccessor<TTenant>` in order to access context for the currnet tenant, which is primarily used by:
  - Extensions (such as Middleware, or Container) - which store things for the tenant in the `ITenantShellAccessor<TTenant>`'s concurrent property bag.
  - Tenant Admin screens - if you need to "Restart" a tenant, then the idea is, you can resolve the `ITenantShellAccessor<TTenant>` and then use extension methods (provided by the dotnettency extensions such as Middleware pipeline, or Container) to allow you to control the state of the running tenant - for example to trigger rebuild of the tenant's container, or pipeline on the next request.


Notes: For details on what Per Tenant Hosting Environment does see the [README on the sample](https://github.com/dazinator/Dotnettency/tree/master/src/Dotnettency.Sample).
